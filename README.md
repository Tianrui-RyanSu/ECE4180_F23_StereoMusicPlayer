## Overview
This project implements a bluetooth controlled stereo music player. The music player loads audio files from an micro-sd card,
which stores both the left and right channels of the songs. The audio files are 8 bit at 8000KHz sample rate ".wav" files. 
The music player is controlled by BluefruitConnect app which establishes a bluetooth connection with the system. The music player
can play/pause and skip forward/backward songs, and can shuffle/order play the entire playlist on the micro-sd card. An LCD display
shows essential playback information like play status (play/pause), play modes (shuffle/order), song name, and song progess bar.
There is also a potentiometer connected to each of the speakers to enable volume control. Two 5V power supplies are needed to power
the 2 speakers, and an additional USB connection is needed from mbed to a computer for power and code changes.
